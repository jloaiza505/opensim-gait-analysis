# opensim-gait-analysis
Automated OpenSim pipeline for inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics analysis to extract joint torque and gait metrics from motion capture data.

Problem Statement

Clinical gait assessment often relies on qualitative observation rather than quantitative joint loading analysis. This project addresses the need for automated biomechanical analysis by building a pipeline that imports motion capture data into OpenSim, performs inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics, and extracts joint torque profiles. The objective is to compute reproducible gait metrics that could inform prosthetic or exoskeleton design decisions.
